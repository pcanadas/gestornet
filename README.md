# GestorNet

This is a Python web application designed for a computer supplies company. This application is web-based and uses the Flask framework.

Notice: This project was started while I was learning Python 3 and the Flask framework. The purpose of this project is purely to give me the opportunity to learn how to code and design a web system and eventually experience the challenges that a full stack developer might face in their daily work.

Below you will find what I use to develop and run the project

- Python 3
- Flask
- SQLite database
- SQLAlchemy
